FLUFF FLUFF FLUFF.

The Solar gains a single Charge whenever:

* He defeats an enemy he has personally fought before.
* Converts a person to his cause.

The Solar gains (Magnitude) Charges whenever:

* He defeats a group that represents a long-standing enemy (an enemy he has encountered in hostile/aggressive situations and is currently unallied and non-neutral towards)
* He converts a group to his cause.
* Makes notable positive changes to a group he commands, leads or rules.  (Better infrastructure, fairer laws, etc...)

All (Ability) Excellencies are discounted one mote per Charge to a minimum mote cost of 0m.
A Charge is lost every 2 hours after any scene which benefited from this discount.
A Solar may not gain more than (their Essence) Charges per action and may not hold more than 6 Charges.

At Essence 4 this Charm upgrades, the Solar may now hold up to (their Essence x 3) Charges.
