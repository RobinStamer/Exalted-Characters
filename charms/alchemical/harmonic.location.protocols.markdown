The Alchemical attunes herself further with her Caste material, sending an Essence pulse to seek any quantity of the same material.
The Alchemical instantly knows the direction and distance to any object, person, cache or vein made of or containing her Caste material within ((Essence + remaining Charges) x 10) yards.
She may make an (Intelligence + Occult) roll to know the person's Essence rating, the Artifact's rating or the cache or vein's Resources rating, all at difficulty of 2.
Should an effect attempt to conceal the object the Alchemical gains her Essence in successes in a roll-off.
