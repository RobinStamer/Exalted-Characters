FLUFF FLUFF FLUFF.
A character looking for a solution finds a physical object that provides that solution, the object is not wholely real, but for all purposes it is when the Infernal observes it.
Each scene the object participates in the reality of the object deteriorates until (Essence) scenes pass and the object unravels entirely.
This Charm can only spawn objects that can be held, and their primary function requires the use of at least one hand.
Either mundane (of any rating) or consumable magical objects with an Artifact rating less than the Infernal's Essence may be created.
