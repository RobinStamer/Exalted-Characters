###Theatrical

So long as the Infernal is capable of seeing the subject of the Charm, the Charm functions on the subject.  Once line of sight is broken, the Charm ceases to function for that subject until sight is restored.  To be able to use a Theatrical Charm on herself, the Infernal must be seeing herself either through a reflection or other means.
