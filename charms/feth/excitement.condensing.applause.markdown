How does one show approval for the entertainment the stage-born endlessly perform?
One simply gives an applause, an echo of the enjoyment, excitement and pleasure the stage-born gave them.

Whenever the Infernal uses an Act of Villany to shed Limit, she regains thrice her Essence rating in motes and begins to sweat raindrops from her body for one hour for each point of Limit she had prior.
The rain functions as a poison with the following traits (Special/one hour, 4, (Essence + Appearance)/10 minutes, -1).
Rather than inflicting damage, this poison accelerates the subject's sex drive, every person of the gender they are attracted to (Appearance 3 or more indicates automatic attraction) sends them into a deep lusting drive.
A subject may resist this drive by paying a single point of temporary willpower, or succeeding on a Temperance roll with a difficulty of 2.
Every minute a raindrop for each mote the user has is sweat from their body and left to fall towards the ground, a single raindrop is a single dose.
