FLUFF FLUFF FLUFF.
The Infernal may adjust the colors of that which she sees, and the dress of those that she sees.
She may use the colors to make someone acting with evil intent more obviously evil to the audience, or dress a drab prince in the most finest of fineries.
Without a stunt, the altered colors or clothing can not be passed off as natural.
This charm automatically ends when the Infernal can no longer see the altered subject.
