There are times when the plot becomes thick and convoluted, leaving the Infernal confused to the current goings-on.
The Infernal makes a social attack with an Investigation-based pool (using any of the three social attributes) against a single target's Dodge MDV, if it succeeds the target is compelled to perform an aside, on a subject of the Infernal's chosing (limited to how their Motivation or Intimacies are involved in the current scene), which only the Infernal and any witness with a Dodge MDV lower than the Infernal's (Essence + Appearance) remembers.
This Charm costs 2 temporary points of willpower for the intial target to resist.
