##Flight Mimicing Fall

**Cost:** 1m; **Mins:** Essence 2<br />
**Type:** Reflexive<br />
**Keywords:** Combo-Ok, Obvious<br />
**Duration:** One Tick<br />
**Prerequisite Charms:** [Unfalling Sky Attitude](unfalling.sky.attitude.markdown)

Not one to merely ignore others' impositions upon herself, the stary-eyed audience mocks their audaicty in silence.
For on tick the Infernal may reverse the forced movement on her person; instead of ignoring it, all activations Unfalling Sky Attitude cause the infernal to move the ignored amount of movement in the exact opposite direction.

At Essence 4 the Infernal may repurchase this Charm to add a 1m surcharge enabling them to extend the Charm to a full action.

At Essence 5 the Ingernal may make a seperate repurchase, adding a 3m surchage enabling them to freely select which direction they travel.

*Example: After two activations of Unfalling Sky Attitude the Infernal is forced to move 8 yards back from an attack, the Infernal activates Flight Mimicing Call in response, and as such moves 8 yards towards the attacker instead.  Later on she is forced to move 14 yards, she activates Flight Mimicing Call again and moves (14 - 10 =) 6 yards towards her attacker.*
