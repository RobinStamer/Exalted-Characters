FLUFF FLUFF FLUFF.
All (Ability) Excellencies are discounted one mote per dot in (Ability)'s corresponding astrological college to a minimum mote cost of 0m.
Correspondingly, the cost of all (Ability) Excellencies are increased by one mote per Charge (applied at the same time as the prior benefit); this can not increase the cost above the original cost of the Excellency.
Whenever the Sidereal uses a discounted (Ability) Excellency, and succeed on the roll, they gain a Charge; up to (their Essence) Charges over a single action.
The Sidereal can carry up to (their Essence x 2) Charges.
Charges disappear at the end of the scene.
