FLUFF FLUFF FLUFF.
Whenever an Abyssal causes an animate (mortal, spirit, fae, etc...) being to lose a point of health or willpower through the use of (Ability), an (Ability) Charm or their native bite attack they gain charges.
For each point of Bashing or Lethal damage they gain one Charge, each point of Aggrevated damage gains them two Charges and each point of temporary willpower is three Charges.
All (Ability) Excellencies are discounted one mote per Charge to a minimum mote cost of 0m so long as the Abyssal is a Blight Zone, Shadowland or the Underworld.
The Abyssal may gain the mote discount benefit in other realms of existance for a scene by paying a point of willpower.
Charges are lost after a week, and at a rate of one per hour the Abyssal is touched by sunlight.
A Abyssal may not gain more than (their Essence) Charges per action and may not hold more than 6 Charges.

At Essence 4 this Charm upgrades, the Abyssal may now hold up to (their Essence x 3) Charges.
