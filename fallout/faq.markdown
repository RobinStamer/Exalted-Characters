##Where are the house rules?

[Here.](rules.markdown)

##What version of Exalted are we using?

2.5, so you'll need the latest Scroll of Errata from Drive Thru RPG.

##Can I play as a GSP, Infernal, Ghost, Fae, Dragon-King or Jade-Born?

No, GSPs don't have demons available for their Exaltation process, the Yozis are dead so Akuma aren't viable and the rest are either wiped out, going to be too weak compared to the rest of the party or simply annoying to ST in a mixed circle.

##Can I play as a Dragon-Blood?

Not yet.  No bloodlines are available for you to Exalt from.

##Must I start from the bunker?

Yes.
