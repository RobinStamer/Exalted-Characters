#General

##Where are the house rules?

[Here.](rules.markdown)

##What version of Exalted are we using?

2.5, so you'll need the latest Scroll of Errata from Drive Thru RPG.

##Can I play as a GSP, Infernal, Ghost, Fae, Dragon-King or Jade-Born?

No, GSPs don't have demons available for their Exaltation process, the Yozis are dead so Akuma aren't viable and the rest are either wiped out, going to be too weak compared to the rest of the party or simply annoying to ST in a mixed circle.

##Can I play as a Dragon-Blood?

Not yet.  No bloodlines are available for you to Exalt from.

##Must I start from the bunker?

Yes.

##Where is the game taking place?

Over IRC

* Network: irc.universaldark.net
* IC Channel: #ExaltedOut
* OOC Channel: #Exalted
* Extra Channel: #Extra (for party splits)

#Plot/Fluff

##What do we know of the Exalted universe?

Not much, you have visions of your past lives, but you can't speak any language they know so you don't have and context clues from that.  You know they were fighting something and eventually were killed in the fight.  You do know the creatures coming from the rifts (fae and bordermarches, respectively) were present during some of those fights.
