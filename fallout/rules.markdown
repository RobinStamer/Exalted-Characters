#General

 * Non-Alchemicals may trade a Caste Attribute/Ability for a Favored
 * BP-based advancement.  I am expecting non-optimized characters.
 * Craft doesn't have sub-abilities, each Craft type is its own specialty
 * Unlimited Specialties per ability, each is capped at 1 dot
 * Drive, Firearms and Lore Charms from Shards are allowed
 * Available backgrounds: Allies, Backing, Contacts, Cult, Familiar, Followers, Henchmen, Influence, Retainers, Past Life
 * Splat specific backgrounds: Aquaintances, Heart's Blood [xp-debted as get more forms]
 * Artifacts are available, any simple Artifact (IE Artifact versions of weapons) in the High-Tech MM (see below) and any other Artifact up to Art 2 provided you can justify the materials somehow.
 * Sorcery initiation Charms include their counterspell and one other, provided there's a means to become initiated.  This applies equally to any other Sorcery-like, such as Necromancy and Protocols.
 * Clarification: Favored traits (including specialties) and Charms never need tutors (exception: MA Charms)
 * When using the "lowest of" for crafting, you may use the highest if the others are at least half of the highest
 * Use Revlid's mutation fix
 * Unless the Charm upgrades an Excellency, Charms that require Excellencies do not.  This applies to Excellency-likes, such as Augmentations.
 * If a player loses a paid background during play they are refunded the cost (eg: familiar dies)
 * Charms that cost XP don't unless they provide a trait, at which point they cost the BP cost of the trait and provide it as a Training effect (IE: paid with BP-debt)

#Solars

 * Can be free of the great curse with a 6pts mutation
 * Clarification: Snake Style can be learned without a tutor
 * SMA Charms cost 7/8bp
 * 38 dots in Abilities

#Abyssals

 * Hungry Ghost can be learned without a tutor
 * SMA Charms cost 7/8bp
 * 38 dots in Abilities
 * Ignore the Appearance/Essence rule
 * When purchasing a Taint Charm the player selects the non-Taint or Taint version.  They may optionally pay the BP cost to switch later on.

#Lunars

 * 9/7/5 Attributes
 * Knacks cost 3bp, 1 week training time, never needs tutors
 * Charms cost 4/5bp
 * Start with 3 free knacks and 3 free Charms, on top of the default
 * Essence is 8bp
 * Can take 2nd Circle Necromancy
 * Can use Resonance instead of the great curse.
 * Heart's Blood is Training effect gained when new forms are aquired.

#Sidereal

 * Use Ronin character generation, with the following exceptions
    * 12 Charms
    * 38 dots in Abilities
    * Each of their Maiden's Colleges starts at one dot
 * Charms cost 4/5bp
 * SMA Charms cost 6/7bp
 * Essence is 8bp
 * Both Charmsets are open (and available)
 * Caste/Favored Abilities cap at 4 before BP is needed
 * Craft (Fate) doesn't exist unless there's a compelling reason for it to
 * Use simple astrology (from Shards)
 * Lose a dot of Paradox every two weeks that you haven't gained any
 * Ride Charms do not force a humanoid template when using them on a Familiar
 * Ox-Body gives two -0 HLs
 * Resplendant Destiny creation is considered a Prayer roll (DC 6)
 * The "activation roll" for RDs is the prayer roll, thus RDs start with effect points equal to one less than the number of months it lasts
 * As a general rule, halve (rouding up) the paradox cost of any Resplendancy or Charm, the same activation of such can't give more Paradox than the Sidereal's Essence in a week.
    * Crow::Feather Cloak Trick (3e, 2p/week) 
    * Sword::Tears of the Blade (2e, 1p), against Exalted it costs an additional point of Paradox.  This bears the Shaping tag.
 * Pattern Spider Byte is treated as ten doses of a poison with the following traits: `0B/1 day, 0, --/--, -1`  No Charms may accelerate, neutralize or otherwise alter the removal of the poison from the Sidereal.

#Alchemical

 * +2 of each Charm-slot
 * +7 Charms
 * 9/7/5 Attributes
 * Essence is 8bp
 * Protocols are: 4bp (Man-Machine) or 5bp (God-Machine)
 * Consider all installed Charms capable of being in an array being in the same array.  Array mote reduction is 1/2 instead of 3/4
 * A purchase of a Charm can be used for 6xp worth of submodules (Must be able to fill all slots)
 * Modified Charms
    * Dedicated Harmonic Targetting::Armor-Bypassing Algorythms -- changed to: no surchage, ignores 2E points of armored soak
    * Integrated Artifact Transmorgifier::Loom Server Migration -- removed, redundant as Alchemicals are now under Fate
    * Optical Enhancement::Cross Phase Scanners -- A single 4xp purchase provides the benefits of both purchases
    * Optical Enhancement::Essence Sight Occulars -- Activation cost is (12 - E)m, 0w; does not flare Anima, requires Cross Phase Scanners
    * Precalculated Evasion System::Transphase Engine -- The Alchemical may activate the utility function (passing through walls) without dodging an attack for a cost of 5m

#Artifacts

 * Beam-weapons are Art + 1 (not Art + 2), they are incompatable with MM-types.  Halve PDV from non-magical sources (Artifact weapons, Charm-augmented PDVs and E4+ defenders), automatically destroy non-magical weapons (E4+ MAist's count as magical weapons, Extras using their fists can have thier fists cut off) used to parry (step 10), MAists using PDV take an additional 2LL (step 7), subtract the damage bonus of the weapon on all mundane armor used to block the attack (step 10) armor that provides 0 soak is rendered unusable.  Weapon is inert until 5m are spent to activate it.
 * High-tech is an alternative magical material removing the attunement cost entirely and providing no other benefit.  No complex (IE stuff from the Codex or Wonders) may be made of this material without explicit permission.  Mortals may use such equipment without any modification.
