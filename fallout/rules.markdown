#General

 * Players may trade a Caste Attribute/Ability for a Favored
 * BP-based advancement.  I am expecting non-optimized characters.
 * Craft doesn't have sub-abilities, each Craft type is its own specialty
 * Unlimited Specialties per ability, each is capped at 1 dot
 * Drive, Firearms and Lore Charms from Shards are allowed
 * Available backgrounds: Allies, Backing, Contacts, Cult, Familiar, Followers, Henchmen, Influence, Retainers, Past Life
 * Splat specific backgrounds: Aquaintances, Heart's Blood [xp-debted as get more forms]
 * Artifact only available if there's a means to get them (IE: a crafter)
 * Sorcery initiation Charms include their counterspell and one other, provided there's a means to become initiated.
 * Clarification: Favored traits (including specialties) and Charms never need tutors (exception: MA Charms)
 * When using the "lowest of" for crafting, you may use the highest if the others are at least half of the highest
 * Use Revlid's mutation fix
 * Unless the Charm upgrades an Excellency, Charms that require Excellencies do not.

#Solars

 * Can be free of the great curse with a 6pts mutation
 * Clarification: Snake Style can be learned without a tutor
 * SMA Charms cost 7/8bp
 * 38 dots in Abilities

#Abyssals

 * Hungry Ghost can be learned without a tutor
 * SMA Charms cost 7/8bp
 * 38 dots in Abilities

#Lunars

 * 9/7/5 Attributes
 * Knacks cost 3bp, 1 week training time, never needs tutors
 * Charms cost 4/5bp
 * Start with 3 free knacks and 3 free Charms, on top of the default
 * Essence is 8bp
 * Can take 2nd Circle Necromancy
 * Can use Resonance instead of the great curse.

#Sidereal

 * Use Ronin character generation, with the following exceptions
 ** 12 Charms
 ** 38 dots in Abilities
 ** Each of their Maiden's Colleges starts at one dot
 * Charms cost 4/5bp
 * SMA Charms cost 6/7bp
 * Essence is 8bp
 * Both Charmsets are open (and available)
 * Caste/Favored Abilities cap at 4 before BP is needed
 * Craft (Fate) doesn't exist unless there's a compelling reason for it to
 * Use simple astrology (from Shards)
 * Lose a dot of Paradox every two weeks that you haven't gained any
 * Ride Charms do not force a humanoid template when using them on a Familiar
 * Ox-Body gives two -0 HLs
 * Resplendant Destiny creation is considered a Prayer roll (DC 6)
 * The "activation roll" for RDs is the prayer roll, thus RDs start with effect points equal to one less than the number of months it lasts
 * As a general rule, halve (rouding up) the paradox cost of any Resplendancy or Charm, the same activation of such can't give more Paradox than the Sidereal's Essence in a week.
 ** Crow::Feather Cloak Trick (3e, 2p/week) 
 ** Sword::Tears of the Blade (2e, 1p), against Exalted it costs an additional point of Paradox.  This bears the Shaping tag.
 * Pattern Spider Byte is treated as ten doses of a poison with the following traits: `0B/1 day, 0, --/--, -1`  No Charms may accelerate, neutralize or otherwise alter the removal of the poison from the Sidereal.

#Alchemical

 * +2 of each Charm-slot
 * +7 Charms
 * 9/7/5 Attributes
 * Essence is 8bp
 * Consider all installed Charms capable of being in an array being in the same array.  Array mote reduction is 1/2 instead of 3/4
 * A purchase of a Charm can be used for 6xp worth of submodules (Must be able to fill all slots)
