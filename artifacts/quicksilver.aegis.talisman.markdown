QUICKSILVER AEGIS TALISMAN (ARTIFACT •••••)<br />
Repair: 3

Originally fashioned by the No Moons of the Lunar Exalted to be an intelligent weapon as ﬂexible and protean as themselves, quicksilver aegis talismans appear as
bejeweled chrome sculptures of cephalopods with various
tentacles looped in hypnotic whorls. When caressed and
attuned for eight motes of Essence (16 motes for non-Lunars), the devices spring to life, looping themselves around
the bearer’s forearm or neck as desired to form an exotic
bracer or torc. The device’s moonsilver tentacles extend and
liquefy, covering the wearer in undulating metal spirals that
sit ﬂush against the skin like armor plates. While attractive
and striking, the tendrils serve as more than exotic armor.
They may also lash out with razor-tipped strands or shape
into rigid blades protruding from any of the wearer’s limbs,
or even ﬂail about to deﬂect attacks and grant protection
comparable to a shield. Best of all, the automaton weapons
can *actively defend the bearer (using Defend Other)* or attack on their own when directed, allowing the bearer
to focus on one opponent while the talisman attacks another
or systematically executes minor opponents who come
too close. Fortunately, the devices can be directed
and programmed with a thought, so they do not
accidentally strike at allies.

The device’s moonsilver tendrils are
all but indestructible and cannot be directly attacked to any
real effect. The actual amulet can be attacked, however, with
a -3 external penalty for its small size, and it always has its
listed soak, regardless of points spent to increase the armor
value. If it is “killed” by damage, the device’s tendrils retract,
and the amulet falls off, inert until repaired.

An attuned bearer can use her
own miscellaneous action or the action of her
quicksilver aegis talisman
to shift its form between offensive and defensive modes. In all, the device has *four* bonus
points to allocate among its features as desired
with each shift. Any unallocated points go towards soak. Each of these points can do any of
the following:

• Add two extra dice of lethal damage to the damage of
the talisman’s lash and blade attacks, increase the lash's rate by 1. Without any points spent
to increase damage, the automaton is incapable of *being used as a blade*.

• Add *3L/3B* to its wearer’s armored soak, without fatigue
or mobility penalties.  This does not count as armor for the purpose of Charms.

• Add *1 to the defence value of the blade and lash, 2 to the lash attack's accuracy.*

**Other Notes**: A quicksilver aegis talisman can make lash
or blade attacks out to a range of four yards. The blades it
grows are weapons useable by its bearer rather than
itself. These automata are not actually sentient,
but capable of identifying threats to their bearer
and immediately responding to those threats with
deadly force. Unless directed otherwise, they will
linger “dormant” with maximized armor, shifting to attack anyone
who initiates hostilities
with as much force as perceived necessary to eliminate
the threat. To this end, their
perceptions are omni-directional,
negating any stealth bonuses gained by
sneaking up from behind and helping to avoid
most surprise attacks.
